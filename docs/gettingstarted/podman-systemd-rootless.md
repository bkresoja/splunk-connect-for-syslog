This variant procedure allows for the sc4s container to run as non root. This method adds a critical restriction
sc4s will be unable to listen on any port below 1024 including the primary default port of 514. This is a security
feature of the Linux OS and can not be modified by SC4S

# Install podman

Refer to [Installation](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

# Initial Setup

* Create a new service account for SC4S and setup the user

```bash
sudo useradd -m -d /home/sc4s -s /bin/bash sc4s
sudo su - sc4s
mkdir -p ~/sc4s/local
podman system migrate
podman pull splunk/scs:latest
podman volume create splunk-sc4s-var
```


* Create the systemd unit file `/lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service` based on the following template:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SC4S Container
Wants=network.target network-online.target
After=network.target network-online.target

[Service]
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=splunk/scs:latest"

# Optional mount point for local overrides and configurations; see notes in docs
Environment="SC4S_LOCAL_CONFIG_MOUNT=-v /home/sc4s/sc4s/local:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/conf.d/local"

# Optional mount point for local disk archive (EWMM output) files
# Environment="SC4S_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_MOUNT=-v splunk-sc4s-archive:/opt/syslog-ng/var/archive:z"

# Mount point for local disk buffer (required)
Environment="SC4S_LOCAL_DISK_BUFFER_MOUNT=-v splunk-sc4s-var:/opt/syslog-ng/var/"

# Uncomment the following line if custom TLS certs are provided
# Environment="SC4S_TLS_DIR=-v /opt/sc4s/tls:/opt/syslog-ng/tls:z"

TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always

ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman pull $SC4S_IMAGE
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman run \
        --env-file=/home/sc4s/sc4s/env_file \
        "$SC4S_LOCAL_CONFIG_MOUNT" \
        --name SC4S_preflight \
        --rm $SC4S_IMAGE -s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run -p 1514:514 -p 1514:514/udp -p 6514:6514 \
        --env-file=/home/sc4s/sc4s/env_file \
        "$SC4S_LOCAL_CONFIG_MOUNT" \
        "$SC4S_LOCAL_DISK_BUFFER_MOUNT" \
        "$SC4S_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_MOUNT" \
        "$SC4S_TLS_DIR" \
        --name SC4S \
        --rm $SC4S_IMAGE
```

* Create the subdirectory ``/home/sc4s/sc4s/local``.  This will be used as a mount point for local overrides and configurations.

    * The empty ``local`` directory created above will populate with templates at the first invocation 
of SC4S for local configurations and overrides. Changes made to these files will be preserved on subsequent 
restarts (i.e. a "no-clobber" copy is performed for any missing files).  _Do not_ change the directory structure of 
the files that are laid down; change (or add) only individual files if desired.  SC4S depends on the directory layout
to read the local configurations properly.

    * You can back up the contents of this directory elsewhere and return the directory to an empty state
when a new version of SC4S is released to pick up any new changes provided by Splunk.  Upon a restart,
the direcory will populate as it did when you first installed SC4S.  Your previous changes can then
be merged back in and will take effect after another restart.

* Create the subdirectory ``/home/sc4s/sc4s/tls``.  This will be used as a mount point for custom TLS certificates
(if the optional mount is uncommented above). 
    
* IMPORTANT:  When creating the directories above, ensure the directories created match the volume mounts specified in the
unit file above.  Failure to do this will cause SC4S to abort at startup.

# Configure the sc4s environment

SC4S is almost entirely controlled through environment variables, which are read from a file at starteup.  Create a file named
``/opt/sc4s/env_file`` and add the following environment variables and values:

```dotenv
SPLUNK_HEC_URL=https://splunk.smg.aws:8088
SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=a778f63a-5dff-4e3c-a72c-a03183659e94
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS=6
#Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates
#SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_TLS_VERIFY=no
```

* Update ``SPLUNK_HEC_URL`` and ``SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`` to reflect the correct values for your environment

* Set `SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS` to match the number of indexers and/or HWFs with HEC endpoints, up to a maxiumum of 32.
If the endpoint is a VIP, match this value to the total number of indexers behind the load balancer.

* NOTE:  Splunk Connect for Syslog defaults to secure configurations.  If you are not using trusted SSL certificates, be sure to
uncomment the last line in the example above.

## Configure SC4S Listening Ports

Most enterprises use UDP/TCP port 514 as the default as their main listening port for syslog "soup" traffic, and TCP port 6514 for TLS.
The unit file and standard SC4S configurations reflect these defaults.  If it desired to change some or all of them, container port mapping
can be used to change the defaults without altering the underlying SC4S configuration. To do this, simply change the initial port in the
`ExecStart` line in the unit file for the main container (which represents the actual listening port on the host machine), like so:

```
-p 614:514 -p 714:514/udp -p 8514:6514
```
This instructs the _host_ to listen on TCP port 614, UDP 714, and TCP 8514 (for TLS) and map them to the standard UDP/TCP 514 and 6514 ports
on the _container_.  No changes to the underlying SC4S default configuration (environment variables) are needed.

### Dedicated (Unique) Listening Ports

For certain source technologies, categorization by message content is impossible due to the lack of a unique "fingerprint" in
the data.  In other cases, a unique listening port is required for certain devices due to network requirements in the enterprise.
For collection of such sources, we provide a means of dedicating a unique listening port to a specific source.

The unit file used to start the SC4S container needs to be modified as well to reflect the additional listening ports configured by the
environment variable(s). In the example below, the `ExecStart` line for the main SC4S container is modified, where 
``-p 5000-5020:5000-5020`` allows for up to 21 technology-specific ports. 

Follow these steps to configure unique ports:

* Modify the ``/home//sc4s/sc4s/env_file`` file to include the port-specific environment variable(s). Refer to the "Sources"
documentation to identify the specific environment variables that are mapped to each data source vendor/technology.
* Modify the unit file ``/lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service`` with the appropriate ``ExecStart`` command line changes using the example below.
* Ensure that you reload the unit file as well as restarting SC4S. See the "Configure SC4S for systemd and start SC4S" section below.
```ini
```ini

```

## Modify index destinations for Splunk 

Log paths are preconfigured to utilize a convention of index destinations that are suitable for most customers. 

* If changes need to be made to index destinations, navigate to the ``/home/sc4s/sc4s/local/context`` directory to start.
* Edit `splunk_index.csv` to review or change the index configuration and revise as required for the data sources utilized in your
environment. Simply uncomment the relevant line and enter the desired index.  The "Sources" document details the specific entries in
this table that pertain to the individual data source filters that are included with SC4S.
* Other Splunk metadata (e.g. source and sourcetype) can be overriden via this file as well.  This is an advanced topic, and further
information is covered in the "Log Path overrides" section of the Configuration document.

## Configure source filtering by source IP or host name

Legacy sources and non-standard-compliant sources require configuration by source IP or hostname as included in the event. The following steps
apply to support such sources. To identify sources that require this step, refer to the "sources" section of this documentation. 

* If changes need to be made to source filtering, navigate to the ``/home/sc4s/sc4s/local/context`` directory to start.
* Navigate to `vendor_product_by_source.conf` and find the appropriate filter that matches your legacy device type.  
* Edit the file to properly identify these products by hostname glob or network mask using syslog-ng filter syntax.  Configuration by hostname or source IP is needed only for those devices that cannot be determined via normal syslog-ng parsing or message contents. 
* The `vendor_product_by_source.csv` file should not need to be changed unless a local filter is created that is specific to the environment.  In this case, a matching filter will also need to be provided in `vendor_product_by_source.conf`.

## Configure compliance index/metadata overrides

In some cases, devices that have been properly sourcetyped need to be further categorized by compliance, geography, or other criterion.
The two files `compliance_meta_by_source.conf` and `compliance_meta_by_source.csv` can be used for this purpose.  These operate similarly to
the files above, where the `conf` file specifies a filter to uniquely identify the messages that should be overridden, and the `csv` file
lists one or more metadata items that can be overridden based on the filter name.  This is an advanced topic, and further information is
covered in the "Override index or metadata based on host, ip, or subnet" section of the Configuration document.

## Configure SC4S for systemd and start SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl enable sc4s
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Start SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Restart SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sc4s
```

If changes were made to the configuration Unit file above (e.g. to configure with dedicated ports), you must first stop SC4S and re-run 
the systemd configuration commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop sc4s
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl enable sc4s
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Stop SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl stop sc4s
```
# Verify Proper Operation

SC4S has a number of "preflight" checks to ensure that the container starts properly and that the syntax of the underlying syslog-ng
configuration is correct.  After this step completes, to verify SC4S is properly communicating with Splunk,
execute the following search in Splunk:

```ini
index=* sourcetype=sc4s:events "starting up"
```
This should yield the following event:
```ini
syslog-ng starting up; version='3.25.1'
``` 
when the startup process proceeds normally (without syntax errors). If you do not see this,
follow the steps below before proceeding to deeper-level troubleshooting:

* Check to see that the URL, token, and TLS/SSL settings are correct, and that the appropriate firewall ports are open (8088 or 443).

* Check to see that the proper indexes are created in Splunk, and that the token has access to them.

* Ensure the proper operation of the load balancer if used.

* Lastly, execute the following command to check the internal logs of the syslog-ng process running in the container.  Depending on the
traffic load, there may be quite a bit of output in the syslog-ng logs.
```bash
podman logs SC4S
```
You should see events similar to those below in the output:
```ini
Oct  1 03:13:35 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: syslog-ng starting up; version='3.25.1'
Oct  1 05:29:55 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: Syslog connection accepted; fd='49', client='AF_INET(10.0.1.18:55010)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:514)'
Oct  1 05:29:55 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: Syslog connection closed; fd='49', client='AF_INET(10.0.1.18:55010)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:514)'
```
If you see http server errors such as 4xx or 5xx responses from the http (HEC) endpoint, one or more of the items above are likely set
incorrectly.  If validating/fixing the configuration fails to correct the problem, proceed to the "Troubleshooting" section for more
information.
